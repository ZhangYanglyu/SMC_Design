## Overview

## What is Sliding Entered Variable(SMC) Method ?
Sliding mode control (SMC) is a nonlinear control technique featuring remarkable properties
of accuracy, robustness, and easy tuning and implementation.SMC systems are designed to drive the system states onto a particular surface in the state space, named sliding surface. Once the sliding surface is reached, sliding mode control keeps the states on the close neighbourhood of the sliding surface.
